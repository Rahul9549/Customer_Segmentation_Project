# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics, allowing businesses to better understand their customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Steps Followed
1. Data Collection: Obtained dataset containing customer information including age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
   - Checked for outliers and applied necessary treatments.
   - Standardized the numerical features to ensure uniform scale.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyzed the distribution of each feature.
   - Explored relationships between features using visualizations such as scatter plots and pair plots.
   - Identified potential clusters or patterns in the data.

4. Dimensionality Reduction:
   - Used t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to reduce the dimensionality of the data for visualization purposes.

5. Clustering:
   - Applied various clustering algorithms including K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to find the optimal number of clusters.
   - Evaluated clustering results using visualization techniques and metrics such as silhouette score.

6. Interpretation:
   - Interpreted the clusters obtained from different clustering algorithms to derive actionable insights.
   - Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to understand customer segments and their behaviors.

7. Conclusion :
   - Summarized findings and recommendations for the business based on customer segmentation results.
   - Discussed potential applications and future work.

## Technologies Used
